- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasXCoder
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, software development, graphic design, and creating innovative tech solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced topics in AP Computer Science, AP Physics, and exploring new programming languages. I’ve also taken multiple college-level courses, including CS111, CS140, CS112, ITIS 150, and ITIS 168, where I earned all As.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving app development, web design, and coding challenges. I’ve worked over 180 hours on the Singleton Foundation Venture Valley Game Development project and completed a 2-week internship at The Coder School, where I taught kids how to code.
